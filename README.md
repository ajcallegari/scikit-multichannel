## Pipecaster overview
Pipecaster is a Python library for building machine learning pipelines out of
scikit-learn components.  It features:

- a multichannel pipeline architecture
- ensemble learning (voting, aggregating, stacked generalization)
- tools for managing complex pipeline architectures:
    - Keras-like layers
    - Visual feedback during pipeline construction
- in-pipeline workflow automation (or 'semi-auto-ML'):
    - screening of input sources based on aggregate features score or
      performance of a probe ML model
    - screening of ML algorithms
    - screening of model hyperparameters
- fast distributed computing with ray

## What is a multichannel pipeline?
A multichannel pipeline is an ML pipeline that takes multiple input vectors
and processes them in separate channels before combining them through
concatenation, voting, or model stacking to generate a single prediction.

## Why use a multichannel architecture?
------------------------------------

- When there are multiple input matrices coming from different data sources or
  feature extraction methods, you can sometimes get better model performance by
  training a separate ML model on each input and then making an ensemble
  prediction.

- You want to automate the selection of input sources, feature extraction
  methods, ML algrithms, and hyperparameters (e.g. when you have a large
  number of related tasks or find yourself screening the "usual suspects" with
  each new task).

- You want to use an enormous number of inputs but don't want the
  computational cost of having your ML model train on all of them.

## Distributed computing with ray
------------------------------
Pipecaster uses the [ray](https://docs.ray.io/en/master/) library to speed up
multiprocessing by passing arguments through a distributed in-memory object
store without the usual serialization/deserialization overhead and without
passing the same object multiple times when needed by multiple jobs.  Ray also
enables pipecaster to rapidly distribute jobs among networked computers.

Installation
------------
```
git clone https://github.com/ajcallegari/pipecaster.git
