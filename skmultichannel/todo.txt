Add wrapper that makes MultichannelPipeline look like a standard single
channel pipeline/

Add distributed hyperparameter screen function.

Add memory / cache support to allow disk caching of transformer results to
accelerate hyperparameter screens (described here
https://scikit-learn.org/dev/modules/compose.html)

OOB errors for SelectivePredictorStack and ChannelModelSelector

Implement model exporting that reduces complexity and footprint to active
input channels and predictors only.

multilabel and multiclass support
also, multilabel support with label subsets (i.e. allow what nikulin called a
“detector net” and intermediate labels).

Get rid of predictor interface detection or add transformer interface detection
for consistency.  Sklearn exposes all possible interfaces, but pipecaster is
mixed, exposing the transformer interface regardless of its internal status
but presenting only the predictor interface that exists internally on the
final layers.
